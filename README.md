# nrk-case

This is a case from NRK, that I performed before a job interview. It is a simple web app
for showing data from a specific csv file.

## Installation
To run the project you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Both of these can be
installed from the same download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. To make sure
they have been installed correctly, type: 
```
npm -version
```
and
```
node -v
``` 
to check if the version
is showed. If not, they have not been installed correctly.


## Project setup
To run the project, cd into the project (wherever it is located on your computer),
make sure you are within the project and not just in the same folder as the project
(the last part of path should be nrk-case). Second option is to open the project 
in an editor or IDE, and run the following commands:
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
